# No micromanagement
Avoid micromanagement

* Practice of autonomous work with probably a little bit far from *ideal* result is better than *ideal* but with micromanagement

# No rushing

Super urgent tasks is a sign of bad planning

* After each case rethink what was the reason and how to avoid it

# Be replaceable
Being replaceable is not a bad thing. It's a good thing.

Specific advises:

* Document everything

  You must make instructions and documentation for everything that you can forget or may need to pass to your colleagues.

  * It's never a question do you have time to make documentation or not. 
  * It's a question whether it will be done or not, because
  * it's possible to postpone the documentations infinitely. 
  * If you really don't have time, that may mean that you took too much responsibilities or, 
    in some cases, you would need to delegate writing proper docs.

* For developers: make maintainable code

  This will help your colleagues to update your code in future

  * write comments on a complicated part of code
  * write tests


# Respectful communication

* Don't use rhetorical questions. They don't help to analyze a problem and move forward.
* Don't use pronouns (*he*, *she*). At least when the person can hear what you said or read what you wrote
* Replace word "Начальник" with "Руководитель" whenever you want to use the first one
* Never use unrespectful gestures: [example](images/gesture.gif)
* Не используй в речи приставку "же" (и близкие), если она используется в качестве выражения недовольства или агрессии, например

  * "мы же договорились"
  * "ты же говорил"
  * "я же сказал" 
  * "я ведь сказал"
  * "я уже говорил"
