*Constitution explains how and in what direction is the company growing*
# I. Just work well
* The only way to compensate poorly made work is to improve yourself and do it well

## I.1. No penalties
* There are no any financial, moral, administrative penalties

## I.2. No excuses
* Inside the company, excuses have no sense

## I.3. Only analysis

* In case of any failure we analyse why it happened and what we can do. At the end we either

  * try to eliminate the cause
  * register that person doesn't follow the rules
  * update the rules

# II. Just enhance Odoo

## II.1. Develop

### Open Source is a power

* Idea that people who download your code will buy it when you close is wrong

  * Only small part of them will do it
  * Someone could make alternative (opensource or not) solution, that can destroy popularity of your code
* In most cases it's good for IT ecosystem

  * People contribute to your code, rather than making the code you already done
  * People make other cool stuff, rather than making the code you already done

* There are quite a few ways to earn with open source

  * Make a service for your software
  * Earn more after getting the reputation

* Exceptions:

  * Customer is asking for proprietary software. If we accept it, we charge twice more, because we lost all other benefits
  * Publishing the source makes IT ecosystem or your service unhealthy. Example: Proxy part of [IAP](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/webservices/iap.html) modules


## II.2. Integrate

### We use global IT ecosystem whenever it makes sense

* Integration is better than no integration
* *All-in-one software* shall not mean *using other software is prohibited*

## II.3. Keep going

### We make only odoo and related stuff
It's better to make odoo only, but do it the best. It's better than do everything but in a middle quality
